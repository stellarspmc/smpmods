# SMPMods
This suite of mods (combined and modified with many other) is for my minecraft server (mc.spmc.tk). It is built around the discord and minecraft server.

# ConfigJava Demo
Since ConfigJava.java isn't publicly available, here is a sample of ConfigJava.java
```java
package ml.spmc.smpmod.utils;

public class ConfigJava {
    public static final String WEBHOOK_URL = "webhook of smp channel id";
    public static final String AVATAR_URL = "http://cravatar.eu/helmhead/%player%/512.png";
    public static final String TOKEN = "bot token";
    public static final String MESSAGE_CHANNEL_ID = "smp channel id";
    public static final String MUSIC_ID = "music vc id";
    public static final String GUILD = "guild id";
    public static final String APPEAL_CHANNEL = "appeal channel id";
}
```
